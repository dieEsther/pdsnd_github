### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data - Udacity Nanodegree Python Project

### Description
The goal for this project was to uncover bike share usage patterns using Motivate data for Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC for the first six months of 2017.
At the heart of the project is the bikeshare.py file which is set up as a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal. 
There are four questions that change the ouput:
1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or Sunday?
The answers to the questions above will determine the city and timeframe for which the user will see some calculated statistics and raw data.

### Files used
The files used were chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv and washington.csv as available via the Udacity nanodegree space.

### Credits
The project scope was pre-defined by Udacity ("Programming for Data Science with Python").
